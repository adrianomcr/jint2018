HolePath: Python list of nodes of the original graph that must be reached in order by the robot. Nodes may repeat, specially if the graph is not Eulerian.
pathNode: Sequence of nodes connecting two nodes of the graph

History():
id: id of the robot
specs: [Vd, Vs] forward velocity (Vd), and search velocity (Vs)

currEdge:
nextNode:
pose:
lastMeeting:
abort_curr_edge: this bool variable is set True after a replanning 
available: this bool variable is True when the robot is available for participating in a raplanning. It is False when waitting for finishing an edge and when already popped all nodes
popped_edges:


waitting_new_plan: Bool variable that is true when a robot met someone and is now waiting a new plan
replan_tasks: 




new_path: 1 if the robot ended an edge between two directly connectd nodes
new_task: 1 if the robot ended the last edge of a concatenated edge between two indirectly connected nodes
